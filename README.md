# Ife-Time-Optimization-in-a-Mobile-Wireless-Sensor-Network-with-Solar-Energy-Harvesting
In this project, mobile wireless sensors send the received solar recharge value and residual energy information to a Base Station (BS), and the BS dynamically optimizes the life time and guarantees a level of the throughput by assigning optimal transmission opportunity of the sensors.
